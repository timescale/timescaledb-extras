# timescaledb-extras

This repository includes helper functions and procedures for TimescaleDB,
particularly as a staging ground for features not ready or appropriate for the
core database, including those written in PL/pgSQL.

The current list of "extras" include:

- Procedures to help backfill data into compressed ranges

## Useful views

In the `views/` directory, there is a number of views that can be
useful. The views are typically added as separate files to allow you
to just include the views that you're interested in.

`chunks.sql`
: Defines views to get information about the time ranges and tablespace for chunks.
